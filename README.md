# ATS_Using_Gemini_Pro

Here I built a Smart Application Tracking System ATS application using Google Gemini Pro LLM Model

Projects can increase Our Knowledge in our prefered domain and I belive using the Knowledge we can create anything in this world 💪 

I've built this Smart ATS using Google's Gemini LLM model, Streamlit for the web interface, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, and Google's Generative AI for the AI model. The system is capable of evaluating resumes based on given job descriptions, providing valuable insights for improving resumes, and assigning a matching percentage based on the job description. 😊 

Google's Gemini is providing a free open source API Keys for building your own larg language model based Generative AI Applications. 🤗 

You have to go to the link :- https://lnkd.in/grxDXSWP , you will get navigated to Google AI Studio makers suit, there you will get the API Keys for Free (as of now). 🌐 

In this Smart ATS we have to just upload the Job Description and then Upload the Resume. Then you will get Job Description Match Percentage, Missing Keywords and Profile Summary of a Resume You have uploaded.

Using this any candidate who wants to apply for the job can get the insights of their Resume, wether their profile is matching or not, if it is not matching more than 85% to 90% then they can modify according to the missing keywords and profile summary absolutly for free. 🆓 

This project wouldn't have been possible without the insightful videos from Krish Naik on YouTube. A big shoutout to him for his valuable content! 🙏😊 

## Steps to run this projects are as follows:

>**Step 1:** Open any editor, In my case I have used VS Code as an editor.
>**Step 2:** Create a virtual environment if  you wanted to deploy your application in any of the website. In My case I have opened a terminal in the VS Code and opened a command prompt then I have given a command **conda create -p venv python==3.10 -y** using this command conda creates a new environment and you need to install the conda environments, For better ease I have installed anaconda in my PC.
>**Step 3:** Create an app.py file outside the venv file but inside the folder of your project.
>**Step 4:** Create a requirements.txt file outside the venv file but inside the folder of your project. Install all the required libraries in the file given.
>**Step 5:** The copy the app.py code which is present in my git and strat runnging the app by Opening the Command Prompt terminal in VS Code. As I have used streamlit framework to run the application you need to use the command **streamlit run app.py**.
>**Step 6:** It will ask the permission for running the app in any of the web browser,  you have to give the permission and then the app starts.

## Technology used in this are:-

>**Programming Languages:-** Python.
>**Libraries used:-** streamlit, PyPDF2, google.generativeai, python-dotenv.
>**LLM Model Used:-** Google Gemini Pro.
>**Framework to run the Gen AI App:-** Streamlit.
